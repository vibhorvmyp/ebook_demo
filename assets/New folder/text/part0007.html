<p class="indent">When the word Yoga is mentioned, most people immediately think of some physical practices for stretching and stress reduction. This is one aspect of the Yogic science, but actually only a very small part and relatively recent in development. The physical Yoga, or Haṭha Yoga, was primarily designed to facilitate the real practice of Yoga—namely, the understanding and complete mastery over the mind. So the actual meaning of Yoga is the science of the mind.</p>
<p class="indent">We all want to know more about our minds: how they work and how we can work with them. This field is closer to us than anything else in life. It may be interesting and useful to know how to fix a car or cook a meal or how atoms are split. But something that holds a more immediate and vital interest for thoughtful people is their own mind. What is the mind? Does it determine our behavior and experience or do we create and sustain its activity? What is consciousness? Can we turn within ourselves to study and understand, perhaps even control the mind? This is the subject matter of the ancient science of Rāja Yoga.</p>
<p class="indent">Traditionally, the word Yoga by itself refers to Rāja Yoga, the mental science. With the current burgeoning of interest in expanding consciousness and in mental science in general, it is natural that we turn to Rāja Yoga. There are of course many Western approaches to the study and control of mind, each advancing various different concepts and techniques. But compared to these, the ancient Yogic science is a great grandsire. For thousands of years the Yogis have probed the mysteries of the mind and consciousness, and we may well discover that some of their findings are applicable to our own search as well.</p>
<p class="indent">The primary text of Rāja Yoga is called the <i class="calibre5">Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali</i> (sometimes also called <i class="calibre5">Patañjala Yoga Sūtras</i> or <i class="calibre5">Yoga Darśana</i>). <i class="calibre5">Sūtra</i> literally means “thread,” each <i class="calibre5">sūtra</i> being the barest thread of meaning upon which a teacher might expand by adding his or her own “beads” of experience for the sake of the students.</p>
<a id="pagexii" class="calibre4"></a>
<p class="indent">There are almost 200 <i class="calibre5">sūtras</i>, traditionally divided into four sections. The first is the Portion on Contemplation (<i class="calibre5">Samādhi Pāda</i>) which gives the theory of Yoga and a description of the most advanced stages of the practice of <i class="calibre5">samādhi</i>, or contemplation. This probably was given first as an inspiration to the student to begin the practices. The second is the Portion on Practice (<i class="calibre5">Sādhana Pāda</i>). There is philosophy in this section also, but of a more practical nature. And the first five basic steps out of the traditional eight limbs of Rāja Yoga are expounded, along with their benefits, obstacles to their accomplishment and ways to overcome the obstacles. The third section is called the Portion on Accomplishments (<i class="calibre5">Vibhuti Pāda</i>) and discusses the final three inner steps of Rāja Yoga plus all the powers and accomplishments which could come to the faithful practitioner. The final section is called the Portion on Absoluteness (<i class="calibre5">Kaivalya Pāda</i>) and discusses Yoga from a more cosmic, philosophical viewpoint.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not known exactly when Sri Patañjali lived, or even if he was a single person rather than several persons using the same title. Estimates of the date of the <i class="calibre5">Sūtras</i> range from 5,000 B.C. to 300 A.D. In any case, he did not in any sense “invent” Rāja Yoga, but rather systematized it and compiled the already existing ideas and practices. Since that time he has been considered the “Father of Yoga” and his <i class="calibre5">Sūtras</i> are the basis for all of the various types of meditation and Yoga which flourish today in their myriad forms.</p>
<p class="center2">****</p>
<p class="indent">Sri Swami Satchidananda (Sri Gurudev) is one of the most widely known and well-rounded contemporary exponents of Yoga. He terms his entire approach to Yoga “Integral Yoga,” or the Yoga of Synthesis, as it takes into consideration all the aspects of an individual: physical, emotional, mental, intellectual and social. But he often states that Integral Yoga is not in any way different from Rāja Yoga.</p>
<a id="pagexiii" class="calibre4"></a>
<p class="indent">Rāja Yoga itself is an integral approach. It does not simply advocate meditation but takes into consideration the entire life of a person. Its philosophy is scientific. It welcomes and, in fact, demands experimental verification by the student. Its ultimate aim is to bring about a thorough metamorphosis of the individual who practices it sincerely. Its goal is nothing less than the total transformation of a seemingly limited physical, mental and emotional person into a fully illumined, thoroughly harmonized and perfected being—from an individual with likes and dislikes, pains and pleasures, successes and failures, to a sage of permanent peace, joy and selfless dedication to the entire creation.</p>
<p class="indent">We see the fruition of this science in Sri Swami Satchidananda. He was born and brought up in a small village in South India. He later studied agriculture, science and technology and worked in various technical and commercial fields. Not satisfied with any of these things, he made the pursuit of Yoga his full-time occupation, practicing first with the help of books and later at the feet of many of India’s great sages and saints, such as Sri Swami Chidbhavananda of the Ramakrishna Order, Sri Ramana Maharshi and Sri Aurobindo. In 1949, he came to the <i class="calibre5">āśram</i> of Sri Swami Sivananda in Rishikesh. In Master Sivanandaji, he found his Guru or spiritual teacher. He took monastic initiation from Master Sivananda and lived, worked and taught at Sivananda Ashram for several years until he was asked by Master Sivanandaji to bring the teachings of Yoga to Sri Lanka. From there Sri Gurudev was invited to other countries in the Far East and then in 1966 to the West.</p>
<p class="indent">Since then he has been recognized and appreciated as a universal teacher, guiding thousands of individuals and serving on the advisory boards of many Yoga, peace and interfaith organizations. Considered a pioneer in the interfaith movement, Sri Gurudev took every opportunity to bring together people of various traditions to see the oneness in all spiritual endeavors. He never called himself an exclusive member of any one faith, group or country but rather dedicated himself to the principle that “Truth is One, Paths are Many.” From that inclusive vision, he went wherever he was invited, bringing together people of all backgrounds and beliefs. He felt that Yoga should stand for, and exemplify, the message<a id="pagexiv" class="calibre4"></a> of respect for all the different paths and that all sincere seekers should realize their common spirit and the universality of their goal.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to Sri Gurudev’s work spreading the teachings of Yoga and his life-long devotion to interfaith understanding, he also dreamed of creating a permanent place where all people could come together and worship under one roof, in a shrine that glorified both the great religious traditions of the world and at the same time, the one Truth—or Light—behind all the names and forms. In July 1986, the Light Of Truth Universal Shrine (LOTUS) was completed—inspired and designed by Sri Gurudev. It is located in the United States at Satchidananda Ashram-Yogaville in Virginia.</p>
<p class="indent">Over the years, Sri Swami Satchidananda received many honors for his public service, including the Albert Schweitzer Humanitarian Award, the Juliet Hollister Interfaith Award, and the U Thant Peace Award. But, for those who knew him, it was not only in his public work but in all aspects of his life that he demonstrated his attunement with nature and his transcendence of petty limitations.</p>
<p class="indent">He is a beautiful instrument to guide us in the study of Rāja Yoga. As he often said, if there is something useful for you in his words, take it and make use of it. If there is anything that is not useful, leave it. May your study of the great science of Rāja Yoga bring you a life of greater health and peace, joy and understanding!</p>
<p class="center2">****</p>
<p class="indent">Sri Patañjali was the epitome of acceptance of all methods and of broad-mindedness of approach. He did not limit his instructions to one particular technique, to members of any particular religion or philosophy, or in any other way. He gave general principles and used specifics only as examples. For instance, in delineating objects for meditation, rather than saying, “Jesus is the only way,” or “Kṛṣṇa [Krishna] is the highest Godhead; meditate on Kṛṣṇa,” or “Only meditation on a sound vibration, or <i class="calibre5">mantra</i>, will bring the Yogic results,” he simply gave various possibilities to choose from and then concluded, “Or by meditating on anything one chooses which is elevating.”</p>
<a id="pagexv" class="calibre4"></a>
<p class="indent">It is probably this broad-mindedness that endeared Sri Patañjali’s <i class="calibre5">Yoga Sūtras</i> to Sri Swami Satchidananda. His ideals and methods are—like Patañjali’s—universal, interfaith and all-encompassing. He denies no one, converts no one, yet recommends techniques of understanding that can expand anyone’s present experience of his or her philosophy, religion and—most importantly—daily life. Although ancient, Sri Patañjali and Rāja Yoga are eminently contemporary. Experimental and scientific, they invite independent questioning and sincere study, analysis and application.</p>
<p class="indent">This book is unique among books on the <i class="calibre5">Yoga Sūtras</i> in that it is based on Sri Swami Satchidananda’s informal expositions of the <i class="calibre5">Sūtras</i> at lectures and Yoga retreats. It was not written for publication or for any scholarly or intellectual purpose, rather it is the recorded conversation of a Yoga Master to his students in true <i class="calibre5">sūtra</i> exposition tradition. It is a dynamic teaching based on the needs of the modern student, expounded by one who lives those teachings. Even the translations are new, coming from the direct experience of Sri Gurudev.</p>
<p class="indent">In bringing out this book, it is our hope to enable seekers after truth and Yoga practitioners in particular to have the great inspiration and practical guidance of Patañjali through the illuminating vision of the modern master Sri Swami Satchidananda.</p>
<p class="indent">Sri Gurudev recommended that readers make note of those <i class="calibre5">sūtras</i> that seem particularly meaningful to their individual lives and memorize them. The words will often come back to mind throughout one’s daily activities and serve as an aid in maintaining peace of mind under all circumstances. Each time you pick up the book, you might find another one or two <i class="calibre5">sūtras</i> that you would like to add to your memory bank.</p>
<p class="indent">May the grace of all the realized Yogis of every tradition be upon us that we may succeed in realizing the peace and joy which is the divine Truth within us.</p>
